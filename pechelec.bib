@article{imbert_relationships_2008,
	title = {Relationships between locomotor behavior, morphometric characters and thyroid hormone levels give evidence of stage-dependent mechanisms in European eel upstream migration},
	abstract = {In order to decipher movements during freshwater eel colonization, we experimentally characterized individual locomotor behavior of two eel life history stages: elvers and yellow eels. A ramp located at the flume tank upstream side required a specific locomotor behavior to be ascended. Placing individually tagged eels in the middle of the tank three times successively tested behavioral consistency. Eels climbing the ramp on each trial were classified as “upstream climbers” whereas eels settling in the tank middle were classified as “inactive”. Both stages exhibited these two opposite consistent behaviors. However, elvers were predominantly “upstream climbers” (58.1\%) whereas yellow eels were predominantly “inactive” (79.6\%). We measured morphometric characters and thyroid hormones to determine if upstream activity was related to body condition and thyroid status. Elver upstream climbers had higher body condition as well as higher thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels compared with inactive elvers. Yellow eel upstream climbers had lower body length as well as higher T3 and ({T3:T4)} ratio compared with inactive yellow eels. This indicated that the physiological release factors for eel upstream migration may be stage dependent. For elvers, high thyroid gland activity, together with high body condition, may be the physiological release factors for migration. In contrast, for yellow eels, physiological stress may be the release factor with an increase in T4 deiodination activity in the smallest eels. Our study revealed inter-stage and intra-stage locomotor behavior plasticity and suggested stage-dependent opposite impacts of physiological condition on eel upstream migration.},
